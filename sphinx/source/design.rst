******************
Program Design
******************

The goal is to create an object-oriented Finite Element Analysis program that

1. is based on the finite element method
#. handles arbitrary trusses in 2D
#. allows for arbitrary loading
#. can plot its undeformed and deformed shape

The program will need and use the following objects:

.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 3

	node.rst
	element.rst
	material.rst
	system.rst
	plotter.rst
